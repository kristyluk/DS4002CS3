# DS4002CS3 Predicting Gender Wage Ratios Case Study 
### Fall 2024 - Kristy Luk

This repository contains information, data, and scripts based on Project 2 of this course, which focused on time-series data. You are tasked to use ARIMA forcasting model to predict gender wage ratios. 

### This repository is organized as follows:
1. DATA
    - full_data.csv --> orginial dataset before cleaning
    - cleaned_data.csv --> cleaned dataset with no N/As
    - 20th_century_data.csv --> data from the cleaned dataset, but only from 1960-2001 for the ARIMA modeling 
    - Data Appendix.pdf --> Data Appendix for all variables in the dataset used for project
      
2. SCRIPTS
    - final_script.ipynb --> a full script containing all of the code needed to reproduce results

3. Reference Materials
    - ARIMA for Time Series Forecasting_A Complete Guide.pdf --> additional information about ARIMA forcasting 
    - Gender pay gap remained stable over past 20 years in US.pdf --> more in depth article about gender wage disparities
      
4. README.md
